# The "R123 plot" is another pre-packaged specialty plot types. This one, is
# just like the "k123" plot in that three copies of the data are overplotted
# using each of the three k-weights with scaling and offset computed 
# automatically. This "R123" plot was plotted as the magnitude of Ï‡(R). The
# "R123" plot respects the value of the r_pl attribute of the Plot object.
