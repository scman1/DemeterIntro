# After the path finder is run, the Feff object has its pathlist attribute
# filled with a reference to a list of ScatteringPath objects. The
# ScatteringPath object is an abstract representation of a scattering path. In
# DEMETER, the ScatteringPath object is somewhat like a feffNNNN.dat is to
# IFEFFIT â€“ it does indeed describe the path, but it needs to imported and
# parametrized before it can be used to make a plot or a fit.
